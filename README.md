## Description
A basic converter, started with binary to decimal and decimal to binary conversions, followed by color code conversions. I will add more converters over time.

## Binary to Decimal and Decimal to Binary Converter
This Converter could be handled by built in functionality of Javascript, but I wanted to see if I could figure out the algorithm myself, and I believe I have.

## Color Converter
Hex <--> RGB <--> HSL <--> HSV
Working on this one at the moment. I need to figure out rounding issues and potential use of regex for input checking.

#### Name
I had to change the name of this from Convertor to Converter as the latter seems to be the correct form of the word in this context
