## Description
A basic convertor, started with binary to decimal and decimal to binary conversions, followed by color code conversions. I will add more convertors and style the page going forward.

## Binary to Decimal and Decimal to Binary Convertor
This Convertor could be handled by built in functionality of Javascript, but I wanted to see if I could figure out the algorithm myself, and I believe I have.

## Hex to RGB to HSL Convertor
Working on this one at the moment. All conversions work, but I'd like to improve the documentation, and figure out rounding issues and potential use of regex for input checking
