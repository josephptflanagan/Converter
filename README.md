## Description
A basic convertor, starting with binary to decimal and decimal to binary conversions. I will add more convertors and style the page going forward.

## Binary to Decimal and Decimal to Binary Convertor
This Convertor could be handled by built in functionality of Javascript, but I wanted to see if I could figure out the algorithm myself, and I believe I have.

## Hex to RGB to HSL Convertor
Working on this one at the moment, Hex to RGB is now functional, RGB to hex too. Anything with HSL is going to take a little while longer as I have to figure out exactly how those values exchange with either Hex or RGB. I will have to refactor the code to modularize it before moving on to HSL.
