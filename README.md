## Description
A basic converter, started with binary to decimal and decimal to binary conversions, followed by color code conversions. I will add more converters over time.

## Base Converter
This converter allows for the conversion between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal based numbers. This converter could be handled by built in functionality of Javascript, but I wanted to see if I could figure out the algorithms myself.

## Color Converter
Hex <--> RGB <--> HSL <--> HSV
Working on this one at the moment. I want to check into potential use of regex for input checking.
I discovered that there are endemic issues with direct conversion between HSL and RGB as it is a projection of three dimensional cube of data to a two dimensional chromaticity plane.

#### Name
I had to change the name of this from Convertor to Converter as the latter seems to be the correct form of the word in this context
